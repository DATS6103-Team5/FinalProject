# FinalProject
## Other possible questions/ topics/ ideas:
Can we identify neighborhood clusters with similar listing patterns and pricing strategies?
How do host attributes (e.g., superhost status, response rate, verifications) relate to listing prices and occupancy rates?
What are the most important factors contributing to positive or negative guest reviews, and how do review scores influence listing demand?
Mapping out areas with high demand, high prices, and high availability.
How do prices and availability change with seasons?
